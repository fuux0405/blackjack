Blackjack the poker game

isn't finished, still work in progress!

so it's Blackjack without betting,
whitout "double" and without "split"
also the ace always counts as 11, only if you get 2 Ace, the one of them counts as 1.

Anyway hope you still have fun :D

EDIT!:

with blackjack_new.py a bidding system is added! ;)

You can chage the amount you start with by changing money in line 21 ... default is 10000â‚¬
